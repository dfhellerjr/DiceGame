# Dice Game

This repo contains the files for a project that uses some advanced HTML, CSS & JavaScript
to create a simple dice game for two players, each with a single roll of a dice. The dice
are 3D representations, the rolls are simulated using a random-number generator and animation provided using CSS transitions.

It is adapted from some nice work I found from Ryan C Perry @ <https://codesandbox.io/u/ryancperry>
